We need to refactor the matches and competitions display to provide better organization:

Matches Dashboard: Show only upcoming fixtures for the user's team
Competitions Dashboard: Display league tables and knockout brackets for all competitions the user's team participates in
Current State
The codebase currently has:

MatchesPage.tsx - Shows matches
Competition data stored in PostgreSQL via dbStorage.ts
Competition engine in competitionEngine.ts
Requirements
1. Matches Dashboard (MatchesPage.tsx)
What to Display:

Only show upcoming fixtures (matches not yet played) for the user's team
Group fixtures by competition (First Division, National Cup, etc.)
Sort by date (earliest first)
Show for each fixture:
Date and time
Home team vs Away team
Competition name
Venue
"Simulate Match" button for matches on the current game date
What to Remove:

Past results (move these to a separate "Results" section or page)
League tables (move to Competitions page)
Fixtures from other teams (not involving the user)
API Endpoint Needed:

2. Competitions Dashboard (New Page)
Create: client/src/pages/CompetitionsPage.tsx

What to Display:

For League Competitions (First Division, Second Division):

Full league table with columns:
Position
Team name
Played (P)
Won (W)
Drawn (D)
Lost (L)
Goals For (GF)
Goals Against (GA)
Goal Difference (GD)
Points (Pts)
Form (last 5 results: W/D/L)
Highlight the user's team row
Show current matchday number
Display promotion/relegation zones if applicable
For Knockout Competitions (National Cup):

Tournament bracket diagram
Show all rounds (Round of 16, Quarter-finals, Semi-finals, Final)
Display match results for completed rounds
Show upcoming matches for current round
Highlight user's team progress
Use a visual tree/bracket structure
API Endpoints Needed:

3. Navigation Updates
Update: client/src/components/ui/navigation.tsx (or wherever navigation is defined)

Add route for the new Competitions page:

4. Database/Storage Updates
Ensure these methods exist in dbStorage.ts:

5. UI Components to Create
League Table Component (client/src/components/LeagueTable.tsx):

Responsive table
Highlight user's team
Sort by points/GD
Show form indicators (W/D/L badges)
Knockout Bracket Component (client/src/components/KnockoutBracket.tsx):

Visual tournament tree
Responsive design for mobile
Highlight user's team matches
Show scores for completed matches
Use connecting lines between rounds
6. Styling Considerations
Use Tailwind CSS classes (already in the project)
Ensure mobile responsiveness
Use Radix UI components for consistent styling
Add visual indicators:
Green highlight for user's team
Gold/silver/bronze for top 3 positions
Red zone for relegation positions
